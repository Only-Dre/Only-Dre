### About Me

I'm a passionate and self-motivated Software Analysis and Development student at SENAI. My fascination with **art, games, and technology** has shaped my path, pushing me to combine creativity with technical skills. I'm especially interested in the intersection of these fields and aim to specialize in advanced **hardware and software development**. My long-term goal is to work deeply with technologies like **GPUs/Graphic Cards** and **AI-powered frame generation**, helping to build the next generation of immersive experiences.
